## Testing 

All pages have been tested across all screen sizes for a responsive experience and web pages have been Styled accordingly.
During this time I realised I made some silly mistakes mainly with sizing and had to go back through and change some size values to work correctly.

Once testing was completed and I was happy with the result I used validators to ensure my code was up to standard and best practices. I did this using W3C validator for HTML, Jigsaw Validator for CSS, WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool) and Lighthouse in Google Chrome.

As this project is static and contains no back-end functionality at this time, the testing performed was on the visual effects and layout of the Website. Testing has been done on at least four web browsers and all screen sizes down to 320px wide.

All nav links direct to the correct html pages as per their names. The Home page is the exception, this one will redirect to index.html.

All links to external websites open in a new browser.

All links show a difference in Color when you hover over the link.

All images are responsive.

### Devices
* I have tested responsiveness and functionality on the following devices and browsers:
    * Apple:
      * Ipad mini
      * Iphone 7
      * Iphone 11
      * Iphone 12
      * Iphone 13 Pro Max

    * Desktops/laptops:
      * Dell XPS15 9570 Laptop
      * MacBook Air
 
    * Browsers:
      * Chrome
      * Edge
      * Firefox
      * Safari

### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - Some errors and warnings have been found when validated the code through official W3C HTML Validator. All of them has been fixed.\

I used lighthouse in dev tools to test the website in many ways, for example I had to test my text colors contrast and adjust accordingly.
As you can see by the above screenshot I used this to improve the websites overall performance.

### Chrome Dev Tools and Responsive Mode
Chrome Dev Tools played a huge role in my testing on a day to day basis, I was able to edit my css in real time to confirm the code I'm writing had to correct output as I was coding. It mostly helped when Styling for responsive mode.

### Links
I tested all links across all pages to make sure they all redirect to the correct pages. I also made sure that for links leading to external websites I used the target _blank attribute to open a new tab so the user does not lose place on our website.

### Accessibility

* Each page has been through wave.webaim.org for accessibility testing.\

### Unfixed Bugs

No bugs identified that needs to be fixed.

I would like more time for styling some of the items to get more responsive.

# Deployment

## Creating My Website
To create this project I used the Code Institute Gitpod Full Template by navigating [here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) and clicking the button labelled 'Use this template'.

Next I was directed to the 'create new repository from template page' and entered in my repo name, then clicked create repository from template button.

The commands used for commits throughout the project:

git add filename - This command was used to add files to the staging area before committing.
git commit -m "commit message explaining the updates" - This command was used to to commit changes to the local repository.
git push - This command is used to push all committed changes to the GitHub repository.

## GitHub Pages

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/michaelrfreitas/p1_web_fooddonationbrazil)

2. At the top of the Repository (NOT at the top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.

3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.

4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".

5. Click Save and the page will automatically refresh.

6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site link in the "GitHub Pages" section. [Link](https://michaelrfreitas.github.io/p1_web_fooddonationbrazil/)

## Forking
Forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea. - This is the definition from Github Docs.

1. Navigate to the GitHub Repository you want to fork.

2. On the top right of the page under the header, click the fork button.

3. Fork

4. This will create a duplicate of the full project in your GitHub Repository.

## Clone

1. Navigate to the Github Repository you want to clone.

2. Click the drop down menu labelled "Clone".

3. Either Download the ZIP file, unpackage locally and open with IDE (This route ends here) OR Copy Git URL from the HTTPS dialogue box.

4. Open your developement editor and open a terminal window in a directory of your choice.

5. Use the 'git clone' command in terminal followed by the copied git URL.

6. A clone of the project will be created locally on your local machine.

## Programs used

* GIT
  * For version control, commiting and pushing to github
* GITPOD
  * The IDE used to code this website
* GITHUB
  * Used to store repositories, files and images pushed from gitpod
* Am I Responsive
  * Used to test responsiveness of the website at different screen sizes
