                Food insecurity is when someone does not have full and permanent access to food. Today, in the midst of
                the pandemic, more than half of the Brazilian population is in this situation, at the most varied
                levels:
                mild, moderate or severe. And severe food insecurity affects 9% of the population â€“ that is, 19 million
                Brazilians are starving.
                The data are from the National Survey on Food Insecurity in the Context of the Covid-19 Pandemic in
                Brazil, developed by the Brazilian Research Network on Food Sovereignty and Security (PENSSAN Network),
                as part
                of the VigiSAN project - <a
