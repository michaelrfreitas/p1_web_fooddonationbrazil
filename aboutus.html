                <p class="texthome">The Food Donation Brazil website has been created to bring an opportunity for people
                    outside Brazil, to understand the situation of the population in this country after the effect of
                    the pandemic. We would like to help people in Brazil with support from anyone in any place in the
                    world. With hands like a volunteer, financial support or food if it is possible. We present some
                    NGOs that support thousands of families and could be supporting more with your help.
                    <br><br>
                    God bless you and thank you for your support.</p>

                        <li><b>Volunteer:</b> You can help with your work, providing a support like a job.</li>
                        <li><b>Money:</b> Provide a financial support, directly for a specific NGO or specific supporting that
                            is going on.</li>

                <p class="texthome">Food insecurity is when someone does not have full and permanent access to food.
                    Today, in the midst
                    of the pandemic, half the population of Brazil is facing some level of food insecurity: mild,
                    moderate or severe. Severe food insecurity affects 9% of the population – in other words, 19 million
                    Brazilians are facing hunger.
                    <br><br>
                    The results of the present study reveal an even steeper deterioration in the past two years,
                    aggravated by the pandemic, with levels of moderate and severe food insecurity back up to levels
                    documented in 2004. This reverse in progress after 2013, and exacerbated in recent years, reveals
                    how the Covid-19 pandemic has added to the existing economic and political crises to significantly
                    erode the right of the Brazilian population to an adequate and healthy diet.
